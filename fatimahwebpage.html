<center><p style = "font-family:Arial">First and foremost I have always dreamed of becoming a programmer since I knew it was a possibility circa 1995 with the movies "Hackers" and "The Net".

The idea of how amazing technology is and how it can be transformed with a few strokes of a keyboard and coding knowlegde had me hooked.</p></center>
